# Car Props Asset Pack

This Asset pack adds a variety of car props to the game. They do not have any functionality and have to be used with caution. They should not cause any pathfinding issues. You can find them in the "Roads->Parking" category to be placed, or in the Add Object Menu.

## DISCLAIMER

Unofficial Custom Assets are highly experimental. They WILL crash your game at some point or throw errors. Create redundant copies of your save files and use at your own risk. There has not been a lot of testing done on custom assets, and I'm publishing this project to get feedback from the community.

## Localization
Localization for the Assets will be coming soon.
